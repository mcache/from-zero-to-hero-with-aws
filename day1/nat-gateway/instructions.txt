#In this lab, we will try to connect to private instance and run update command - which will objective is to update OS (it will download all resources from Internet)

1) Copy your SSH key from your local env (Cloud9 is ok) to public instance

scp  -i "workshop.pem"  workshop.pem ec2-user@YOUR_INSTANCE_IP:/home/ec2-user/workshop.pem

2) SSH to your public instance. You should have there your SSH key. You can validate it using "ls" command.

3) Change permissions on key:

chmod 400 "workshop.pem" 

4) Try to update your PUBLIC instance

sudo yum update -y
